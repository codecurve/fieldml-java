    Mapped field reading in data from a separate file.
      
    NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
    
    The parsing application reads in data, starting at the given offset, and
    skipping the given number of bytes between each record. Each record
    consists of a single key of the given format, followed by a number
    of values matching the component count of the mapped_field's value
    domain. The key format must be an integer format, typically 8, 16 or 32
    bits. The value format must match the domain value's base type, be it
    floating point for reals, integer for reals or indexes, or ASCII, unicode
    or some other format for strings.  

    Little-endian and big-endian formats should be supported.
